# DeCaires_SineWave_Simulation
This sketch is an abstract simulation inspired by the movement of a vibrating string or rope. This specific example is 
a first draft for an upcoming less abstract version. In this sketch, the motion of each wave models a single sine wave
where one end of the string/rope is fixed and the other is not. There is also no reflection or intereference simulated.

**Instructions**

The included files are a screenshot and screen recording of the code running, as well as my preliminary notes and sketches
for the conceptual understanding of standing waves and partial harmonics. These are all for reference and not necessary 
to run the code. All needed to run the sketch are the lines of code.
